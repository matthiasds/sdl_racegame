/**
 * EnemyCarControlSystem:
 * This System controls the EnemyCars.
 * This systems mane task is lane switching for collision prevention. The system searches for neighboring EnemyCars and takes action based
 * upon the neighbors' positions. It uses a left take over. And no traffic keep right system as common in Europe. When there is no possibility
 * to take over the speed will be adapted to the preceding car.
 * Note that this systems only takes into account enemy  cars. It behaves like the PlayerCar is totally invisible so with the playerCar there
 * is no collision prevention. Otherwise the game would be too easy of course...
 * To switch lanes only the new wantedLane is set in the LaneComponent. The CarLaneMovingSystem takes care of the actual moving, following and
 * centering on the new lane.
 * The distance of which enemy cars become aware of a preceding, following or passing car is based on the laneWidth. If the factor is changed it
 * is possible cars start to late with taking over and collide anyway. Also in X direction the cars should only be awere of the cars 1 lane next
 * to them. If set to big. They will be aware of cars 2 lanes next to them and will not take over unless 2 lanes are free...
 *
 * As in Component EntitySystems the System is used for all entities containing certain components. An extra EnemyCarComponent is created to
 * make this exclusive.
 * Although it should possible to also use this system for the PlayerCar by the advantage of modularity of a Component Entity System.
 * For example a bonus for a 10s high speed autopilot for the PlayerCar could temporary add this System to the PlayerCar...
 *
 * As the processEntity function can only execute at 1 entity at a time there was a problem to analyze the interactions with the other entities
 * In most Component Entity Systems this is solved by other Systems and group managers that can behave on multiple entities. Here I have created
 * an own way of dealing with this deviating from the standard CES pattern. It works by creating an extra SharedEnemyCarComponent which is created as
 * singleton. Each entity creating the EnemyCarComponent is added to an entityList in the SharedEnemyCarComponent. Each EnemyCarComponent contains
 * a pointer to the sharedEnemyCarComponent so the entityList can be accessed from each component. In this way they entities subscribing to the same
 * component are aware of each other. In this way the component function is recycled in a creative way to prevent adding another complicated CES part
 * like the group manager.
 * Only future can tell if this deviation can work in all situations (new design patterns can only be proven to work by extensive use in different
 * applications). But in this rather limited game it works out quite well.
